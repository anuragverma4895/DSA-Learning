# DSA-Learning

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms Learning Repository** 🚀  
This repository contains all the code, practice files, notes, and resources I’ve used while learning **DSA using the C programming language**.

---

## 📌 Why This Repository?

This repository is part of my **learning journey**.  
It is not a project repository, but a **study and practice record** that shows my continuous progress in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

Here you will find:
- DSA concepts implemented in C
- Practice problems
- Notes and PDFs
- Learning resources collected during my study
